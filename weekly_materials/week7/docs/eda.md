## Exploratory Data Analysis 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a process of critical scrutiny of data in relation to the problem at hand. Generally speaking, any method of looking at data before fitting the model falls under the realm of exploratory data analysis. 

EDA helps in:<br>

- Understanding the quality, quantity, and the utility of data <br>
- getting familiar with data distribution <br>
- Formulating a plan to massage the data<br>


Data for predictive modelling generally comes in the form of a rectangular array with rows representing records or observations on subjects. Column values typically contain one outcome variable and one or many predictor variables (features)  that contain either the numeric values (ratio and interval) for quantitative features or nominal and ordinal values for categorical ones.

Each of the features and target variables in the dataset can be explored  individually or in relation to each other. The technique might vary depending upon whether the features are of categorical or numeric types. EDA could involve  statistical summaries, tabular analysis, and graphical methods.

EDA should be done with following question in mind:

#### 1. What kind of features (variables or columns) are there? Is there any need for type conversion?
#### 2. How is the data distributed across different features? Are there any outliers you need to be concerned about?
#### 3. Is there any need for data cleaning? Are there any missing values?
#### 4. How do  feature values in relation to each other and target variable?
#### 5. Are there any observable trends, patterns, and  anomaly visible in the graphical analysis of data?

Each of these questions will be treated seperately or in combination in the next few lectures of this week.
